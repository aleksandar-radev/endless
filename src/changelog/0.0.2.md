- Remove increased material drop rate for materials on higher stages. They are stable throughout all stages now.
- Soul shop rebalance. Most things are now more expensive.
- Fixed Soul Shop's "Extra Life". It now grants one resurrection per run.
- Resurrection can happen twice per run. Once with soul shop upgrade, and once with bonuses from items.
- Fixed Bonus Gold and Bonus Experience from Soul Shop. They are now displayed as percentages.
- Material drop rates are now consistent across all stages, with extra material drops only from Soul Shop upgrades. (compared to previously where higher stages had increased drop rates)
- Damage, healing, and combat notifications are now clearer and color-coded in battle.
- Fixed: Player and enemy health/mana bars update more reliably after combat events.
