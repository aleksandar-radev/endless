    <span style="color:#FF8A00;">Improvements</span>
    <ul>
      <li>XP, gold, item quantity, and item rarity bonuses on gear scale with tier-based percentage caps instead of being limited to 100% (making them cap at 1200% for tier 12 gear).</li>
      <li>Removed quick buy separate options, and made it just 1 (you should probably go adjust your options). Quick buy and bulk buy available for training, skills and soul shop.</li>
      <li>Added Armor Penetration and Elemental Penetration training along with new item rolls for weapons, gloves, and jewelry.</li>
      <li>Enabled All Attributes rolls on all non-weapon equipment.</li>
    </ul>

    <span style="color:#FF8A00;">Bug Fixes</span>
    <ul>
      <li>Corrected Rocky Field elemental resistance scaling so high-tier enemies gain resistances alongside their armor.</li>
      <li>Ensured thorns damage triggers even when the hero blocks an attack.</li>
      <li>Again, fixed soul shop quick buy functionality.</li>
    </ul>
