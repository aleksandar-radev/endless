- Added a "Starting Stage" option, allowing you to choose your starting stage based on your crystal upgrades.
- Fixed: healing / damage popups above hero not always correctly shown (color/text bug)
- Mana requirement for some skills have been reworked.
- Reduced scaling of items of higher rarity. Mythic items are now not 30 times as strong as common items, but only ~5-6 times as strong.
- Fixed a bug where upgrading the level of an item would not always correctly update the item stats.

<strong>Note: if you have "bugged" items, you might want to salvage them.</strong>
