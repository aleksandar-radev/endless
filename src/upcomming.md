# Upcoming Changes

\*not guaranteed to be in the next update

> <br>

- Most skills will get level caps, especially the strongest ones.
- Dexterity will be nerfed, as items currently give too much dexterity, causing crit damage to be extremely high.
- Item scaling will be reduced; lower-level items will become more useful.
- Percentage-based damage and crit damage will be capped for items.
- Mana will be reworked, since after a few hours of play, you get so much mana it never runs out.
- Skill level-ups will be capped to your hero's level.
- New stats will be added: evasion, elemental resistances.
- Enemies will deal physical and elemental damage based on their type.

## <span style="color: red;">Upcoming reset of all data. Will notify a few days before it happens.</span>

## Backup your save, if you want to keep it. Contact me on Discord if you need help with that. An update will happen on Monday 16th of June 2025, which may result in data loss. (hopefully not). THIS IS NOT RESET OF ALL DATA.
