# Upcoming Changes

\*not guaranteed to be in the next update

> <br>

- Most skills will get level caps, especially the strongest ones.
- Dexterity will be nerfed, as items currently give too much dexterity, causing crit damage to be extremely high.
- Item scaling will be reduced; lower-level items will become more useful.
- Percentage-based damage and crit damage will be capped for items.
- Mana will be reworked, since after a few hours of play, you get so much mana it never runs out.
- Skill level-ups will be capped to your hero's level.
