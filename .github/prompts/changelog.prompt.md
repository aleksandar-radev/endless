- summarize all the changes i'm about to commit and write out in the latest changelog file (/src/changelog/).
- considering it will be players/users looking at it, strip all dev logic
- keep it more clean and concise. remove very general points
- keep structure similar to other changelog files (e.g. /src/changelog/0.0.1.md)
- update version in package.json and options.js
- add migration with same version in migrations folder
