# Copilot Instructions for This Project

- Use modern JavaScript (ES6+) syntax and features.
- Prefer functional programming patterns where possible.
- Always use async/await for asynchronous code, avoid .then() chaining.
- Use descriptive variable and function names.
- Add JSDoc comments to all functions and exported objects.
- Write concise, self-explanatory code; avoid unnecessary complexity.
- For UI code, prefer semantic HTML and accessible ARIA attributes.
- When handling errors, always log them and provide user-friendly messages.
- Use destructuring for objects and arrays where appropriate.
- Avoid using deprecated or experimental APIs.
- Assume the user is an expert — skip over-explaining, but do not omit essential code structure or validation.
- Suggest alternative solutions only when they align with project conventions.
- For Copilot Chat: If something is unclear, ask concise clarifying questions.
- Follow the project’s code style
- Consider edge cases and security best practices in all code.
